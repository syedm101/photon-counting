# photon-counting

**See `Report PHYS 3995.html` for a summary of work done**

Use `thresholdChooser.py` to determine filter channel and OPO channel photon level thresholds, change these corresponding values in `peakFinderWindowHeralding.py` and then run this program to obtain photon numbers and heralding ratios. `wignerCalculator.py` takes in similar parameters but processes an entire folder to create a Wigner function plot over several data traces, assumed to be at different displacements.

The python notebooks look at different cases of specific data sets for analysis.
